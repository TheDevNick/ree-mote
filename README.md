# Snap (Potential Client Landing Page)
This is a simple responsive landing page for a potential client. It was a quick prototype just to show the client of the potential look they were looking for.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox, Media Queries

After talking to a potential client, they wanted me to create a quick prototye landing page to see how their site could look if they were to move foward with the process. This landing page was done using html, css, flexbox, and media queries. I took the photoshop image that was given to me and converted it into a landing page. 

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

If I had enough time I would have done a few more things such as making the mobile version of the menu a hamburger so when it is click it shows the navigation. Another thing that I would have done was add a light mode/dark mode feature since some users like the option to toggle between the two. I could have used bootstrap to make this development process quicker but I just decided to use flexbox and that was good enough for the prototype. 

## Lessons Learned:

I should have went the mobile-first design approach when creating this prototype since the is best practice. I think the landing page still ended up being pretty nice.
